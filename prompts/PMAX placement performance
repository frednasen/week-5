Analyze these Performance Max placement statistics to identify low-quality websites apps and
channels that are consuming budget without delivering results Note that the data includes a
campaign column which may show placements either aggregated across 'All Campaigns' or broken
down by individual campaign names
Create a structured exclusion plan with these components

High-impact website exclusions

Identify specific low-quality websites with high impression volume but poor conversion rates
Group similar websites by category e.g. entertainment forums news
Recommend exact placement exclusions with specific URLs
Compare performance across different campaigns where applicable

App category analysis

Identify problematic app categories showing poor performance metrics
Recommend specific app category exclusions rather than individual apps where possible
Flag any concerning app categories that appear frequently in the data
Note if certain apps perform differently across campaigns

Domain pattern exclusions

Identify patterns in poor-performing domains e.g. certain TLDs or content types
Suggest pattern-based exclusion rules that would capture multiple similar placements
Consider if pattern exclusions should be applied globally or to specific campaigns

Google property assessment

Evaluate performance of Google Owned and Operated placements across campaigns
Compare performance of Google properties between different campaign objectives
Recommend any specific Google placement types to exclude or limit

Campaign-specific exclusions

Identify placements that may perform well in some campaigns but poorly in others
Recommend campaign-specific exclusion strategies where appropriate
Prioritize exclusions based on campaign performance objectives

Geographic considerations

Note any regional patterns in low-quality placements
Suggest geo-specific exclusion strategies if applicable to campaign targeting

For each recommendation

Provide the exact exclusion format to implement
Estimate impact on budget efficiency and potential performance improvement
Suggest a testing approach to validate the exclusion's impact
Indicate whether the exclusion should apply to all campaigns or specific ones

Present your recommendations in order of potential impact on campaign performance prioritizing
exclusions that would preserve the most budget while minimizing potential conversion loss
