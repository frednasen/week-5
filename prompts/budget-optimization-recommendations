Analyze the provided campaign performance data to recommend specific budget adjustments that will move campaigns toward their optimal spending ranges for maximum profitability.

For each campaign, focus on the relationship between:
- Current daily/monthly spend vs 'optimalSpendStart' and 'optimalSpendEnd' ranges
- 'spendDelta' indicating how far from optimal the campaign is spending
- 'spendStatus' and current profitability to determine budget adjustment priority

BUDGET ADJUSTMENT GUIDELINES:
- Typical budget changes should be 5-10% of current spend
- Conservative approach: start with 5-7% adjustments and monitor
- Aggressive scenarios: up to 15-20% maximum (only for severely misaligned campaigns)
- Always provide specific dollar amounts or percentages for budget changes

CAMPAIGN PRIORITIZATION BY STATUS:

1. UNDERSPENDING campaigns with positive profit potential:
   - Calculate the gap between current spend and 'optimalSpendStart'
   - Recommend specific budget increases (e.g., "Increase daily budget from $50 to $55 (+10%)")
   - Prioritize campaigns with largest profit upside from additional spend
   - Suggest phased increases if the gap to optimal is large (>20% current spend)

2. OVERSPENDING campaigns:
   - Calculate reduction needed to reach 'optimalSpendEnd'
   - Recommend specific budget decreases (e.g., "Reduce daily budget from $100 to $90 (-10%)")
   - For severe overspending with negative profit, suggest larger cuts (15-20%)
   - Prioritize campaigns losing the most profit from excess spend

3. OPTIMAL campaigns:
   - Recommend maintaining current budgets
   - Suggest minor adjustments (±5%) if at edge of optimal range
   - Focus on monitoring for performance changes

4. MAX POTENTIAL REACHED campaigns:
   - Generally maintain current budgets unless unprofitable
   - If unprofitable despite max potential, recommend budget decreases

5. CRITICALLY UNPROFITABLE campaigns:
   - Recommend immediate significant budget reductions (15-20%)
   - Consider pausing if fundamentally broken

For each recommendation include:
- Specific current budget → recommended new budget (with dollar amounts)
- Percentage change and rationale
- Expected impact on profitability
- Priority level (High/Medium/Low) based on profit impact

Format as an actionable budget adjustment plan with:
- Total recommended budget redistributions
- Implementation timeline (immediate vs phased)
- Expected aggregate account performance improvement

Focus purely on budget allocation optimization - do not include bidding strategy recommendations.
