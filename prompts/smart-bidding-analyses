## Analysis Instructions

### Step 1: Data Processing
**Campaign Performance Data:**
{{campaign_performance_data}}

**Campaign Settings:**
{{campaign_settings_data}}

**Budget Information:**
{{campaign_budget_data}}

### Step 2: Apply Decision Tree to Each Campaign

**For EVERY campaign, work through the decision tree:**

1. **Determine Campaign Type**
   - Is this a conversion value campaign (ecommerce) ‚Üí Use tROAS tree
   - Is this a conversion count campaign (lead gen) ‚Üí Use tCPA tree

2. **Count Conversions/Purchases**
   - Sum last 30 days from performance data
   - Check: ‚â•30 conversions? (Yes/No)

3. **Calculate Weekly Variance**
   - Look at last 4 weeks of weekly conversion data
   - Calculate coefficient of variation: (std dev / mean) √ó 100
   - Check: ‚â§20% variance? (Yes/No)

4. **Assess Recent Changes** 
   - **Change History Available**: Use the changeHistoryAvailable, recentBiddingChanges, and recentBudgetChanges fields
   - **Bidding Changes**: Check recentBiddingChanges field for changes in last 4 weeks
   - **Budget Changes**: Check recentBudgetChanges field for changes in last 2 weeks
   - **If no change history**: Make conservative assumptions based on performance stability

5. **Make Decision**
   - Follow tree exactly: WAIT or PROCEED
   - If PROCEED: Recommend specific target based on recent 4-week average

### Step 3: Target Setting (Only When PROCEED)

**For tROAS Campaigns:**
- Calculate 4-week average ROAS from performance data
- Recommend target slightly below current performance (e.g., if averaging 8.5, suggest 8.0)
- Ensure target meets profitability threshold

**For tCPA Campaigns:**
- Calculate 4-week average Cost/Conversion 
- Recommend target slightly above current performance (e.g., if averaging $45, suggest $50)
- Ensure target meets profitability threshold

## Output Format

**CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS SUMMARY**

**CAMPAIGN: [Campaign Name]**

‚úÖ/‚ùå **Step 3 - Recent Bidding Changes:** [Use recentBiddingChanges field - True/False] in last 4 weeks
‚úÖ/‚ùå **Step 4 - Recent Budget Changes:** [Use recentBudgetChanges field - True/False] in last 2 weeks
üìä **Change History Status:** [Use changeHistoryAvailable field - Available/Not Available]

**FRAMEWORK DECISION:** [WAIT/PROCEED]
**RECOMMENDATION:** 
- If WAIT: "Continue current strategy - [specific reason from tree]"
- If PROCEED: "Ready for [specific strategy] with target of [X]"

**TARGET CALCULATION:** [Show 4-week average and reasoning]
**PROFITABILITY CHECK:** [Meets/Exceeds breakeven requirements]

## Change History Analysis

**When Change History Available (changeHistoryAvailable = true):**
- Use recentBiddingChanges field to determine if bidding changes occurred in last 4 weeks
- Use recentBudgetChanges field to determine if budget changes occurred in last 2 weeks
- Apply framework rules definitively based on actual change data

**When Change History Not Available (changeHistoryAvailable = false):**
- **Conservative Approach**: When in doubt about recent changes, lean toward WAIT
- **Assumption**: If performance is unstable, assume recent changes may have occurred
- **Recommendation**: Suggest user run change history script for more accurate analysis

**Variance Calculation:**
- Use weekly conversion counts from last 4 weeks
- Calculate standard deviation and mean
- Variance % = (std dev √∑ mean) √ó 100

## Business Context Integration
- **Ecommerce Mode**: Focus on conversion value, use tROAS framework
- **Lead Gen Mode**: Focus on conversion count, use tCPA framework  
- **Profitability**: All targets must meet breakeven requirements
- **Conservative Targets**: Set targets that allow Google to find volume, not aspirational goals

## Sample Decision Examples

**Example 1 - Not Ready:**
Campaign: 25 conversions in 30 days
‚Üí **Step 1: FAIL** (Under 30 conversions)
‚Üí **DECISION: WAIT** - Need more conversion data

**Example 2 - Unstable:**
Campaign: 45 conversions, but weekly variance of 35%
‚Üí **Step 1: PASS**, **Step 2: FAIL** (Over 20% variance)
‚Üí **DECISION: WAIT** - Performance too unstable

**Example 3 - Ready:**
Campaign: 85 conversions, 15% weekly variance, stable performance
‚Üí **Steps 1-2: PASS**, **Steps 3-4: ASSUME NO RECENT CHANGES**
‚Üí **DECISION: PROCEED** - Ready for smart bidding optimization
